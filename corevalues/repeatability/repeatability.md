# Repeatability

Repeatability is achieved through consistent processes and writing reliable code. Repeatability is facilitated through [automating repeatable tasks](/practices/automate/readme.md), [TDD](/practices/tdd/readme.md), and [vertical slicing](/practices/verticalSlicing/readme.md). Repeatability is also managed through [pair programming](/practices/pairProgramming/readme.md), and [refactoring](/practices/refactoring/readme.md).

## Project Management and Planning

Planning and project management through Scrum or Kanban manifests repeatability through consistent and reliable development processes. Consistent processes begets consistent development and likely consistent delivery.

## Automate Repeatable Tasks

Manual tasks are prone to error, where as automated tasks are consistent and reliable. To maintain code repeatability it is best to automate repeatable tasks as much as possible to remove inconsistencies. For more information on automating repeatable tasks click [here](/practices/automate/readme.md).

## Testing and TDD

Test Driven Development ensures we have tests that check our code is running as expected. Automated well written tests allows the team to verify that the code produces repeatable functionality even after refactoring or adding new functionality. For more information on writing tests and TDD click [here](/practices/tdd/readme.md).

## Vertical Slicing

Vertical slicing facilitates consistency. For more information on vertical slicing click [here](/practices/verticalSlicing/readme.md).

## Pair Programming

Pair Programming works to enhance repeatability within and across projects through knowledge sharing and continuous feedback between developers. For more information on pair programming click [here](/practices/pairProgramming/readme.md).

## Refactoring

Refactoring works towards repeatability through cleaning and simplifying code. For more information on refactoring click [here](/practices/refactoring/readme.md)
