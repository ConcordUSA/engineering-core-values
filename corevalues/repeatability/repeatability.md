# Repeatability

Repeatability is achieved through consistent processes and writing reliable code. Repeatability is facilitated through [automating repeatable tasks](/practices/automate/readme.md), [TDD](/practices/tdd/readme.md), and [refactoring](/practices/refactoring/readme.md).

## Project Management and Planning

Correct project management enables repeatability by creating consistent and reliable development processes, an example of such a practice is implementing [vertical slicing](/practices/verticalSlicing/readme.md). Development planning processes such as Scrum and Kanban also enable repeatability by providing a consistent framework for project management. Consistent processes beget consistent development and likely consistent delivery.

## Automate Repeatable Tasks

Manual tasks are prone to error, where as automated tasks are consistent and reliable. To maintain code repeatability it is best to automate repeatable tasks as much as possible to remove inconsistencies.

## Testing and TDD

Test Driven Development ensures we have tests that check our code is running as expected. Automated well written tests allows the team to verify that the code produces repeatable functionality even after refactoring or adding new functionality. For more information on writing tests and TDD click [here](/practices/tdd/readme.md).

## Refactoring

Refactoring works towards repeatability through cleaning and simplifying code, such as refactoring a repeated code block into its own method. For more information on refactoring click [here](/practices/refactoring/readme.md)
