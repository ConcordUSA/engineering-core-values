## Getting started with the domain modeling module.

### Step 1: 
Open the ShoppingCartTest.java file in the test directory and notice the commented out test cases at the top of the file. 
Your job is to uncomment these tests and implement the methods required for them to pass successfully. 

### Step 2: 
The following 5 tests in the ShoppingCartTest.java file need to be implemented.
These tests outline the business requirements in the test names.
Arrange the tests so that the prior conditions outlined in the `when` part of the test name are satisfied.
Then act on the required object and assert that the conditions are satisfied when the action is finished.
In some cases, you will need to implement new functionality in the class you are testing.
