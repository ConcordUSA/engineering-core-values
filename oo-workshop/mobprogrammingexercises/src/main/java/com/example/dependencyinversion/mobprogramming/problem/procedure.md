### Getting started with Dependency Inversion
Start by refactoring the classes in the `dependencyinversion.problem` directory to satisfy DIP.
You will need to consider how to best align your classes with this principle before implementing anything.
Afterwards, adjust the test classes to pass using the refactored classes.
