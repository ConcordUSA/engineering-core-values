# Aquarium Servicing

Our customers have some complaints,
we're going to have to change how we service aquariums, or we'll lose business:

* first, we're going to need to stop worrying about fish being chilly, they prefer a breezy 70
  * cold-blooded doesn't mean they're cold
* second, we stop guestimating with the chemical balancing and test our PH level first
* third, we're going to switch to battery operated filters and heaters
  * we bought a whole bunch of battery operated filters and heaters on accident
  * no one asked for this, but we're going to sneak it in anyway
* fourth, we need to stop over-trimming plants, we ran out of `GreenThumb`s a while ago
* fifth, my notes are getting pretty tear stained, so let's just do the first 4 things
  * there is a nice way to ask for changes to our AquariumService, sheesh
