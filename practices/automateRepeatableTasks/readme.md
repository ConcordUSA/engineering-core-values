# Automate Repeatable Tasks

Humans are error prone; we are very bad at doing the same thing over and over. Machines, on the other hand, are very good at repeatable tasks! When working on a software project, we should strive to reduce any manual steps as much as possible. This will save time, reduce errors, but also add predictability to our software. "Works on my machine" is never an acceptable excuse! =)
