# Automate Repeatable Tasks

Humans are error prone; we are very bad at doing the same thing over and over. Machines, on the other hand, are very good at repeatable tasks! When working on a software project, we should strive to reduce any manual steps as much as possible. This will save time, reduce errors, but also add predictability to our software. "Works on my machine" is never an acceptable excuse! =)

## The What and the Why

### The What

Automation of repeatable task is simply explained as the process of performing repeatable tasks automatically. Repeatable tasks can be found in many aspects of work at Concord such as planning, development, and deployment.

### The Why

Automation of repeatable tasks reduces repeatability errors created by humans and increases efficiency.

## Examples

### Planning

Some examples of tasks you may need to automate in planning could be:

1. Backlog, Sprint and Retro set ups
2. Weekly stand up meetings

Solutions:

1. JIRA, Azure DevOPs
2. Event Scheduler

### Development

Some examples of tasks you may need to automate in development could be:

1. Formatting or displaying features
2. Repeated set up for a class or method
3. Any repeated set up for desired functionality
4. Dependency injection
5. State management on front end
6. Managing infrastructure

Solution:

1. CSS styling sheets
2. Use abstract methods and classes
3. Create a function or class to avoid repeated code
4. Programs like Spring Boot
5. Programs like Redux or Flux
6. Cloud computing or programs like Docker

### Deployment

Some examples of tasks you may need to automate in deployment could be:

1. Starting the database
2. Booting the API layer and Front end
3. Hosting services in containers
4. Testing
5. Static Analysis
6. Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance checks

Solutions:

Create a deployment pipeline! Use software like Azure DevOps to automate these tasks for deployment and testing.
