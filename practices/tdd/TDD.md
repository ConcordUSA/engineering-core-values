# Test Driven Design

Test driven design enables us to build software with a simple design and enables us to ruthlessly refactor. It also enables us to ship software quickly and frequently (umm Agile anyone??) as we have a bed of tests delivered with all new functionality.

## Examples

The [examples](examples) directory contains practical examples / guidelines for various technologies and technical domains for implementing unit testing.

Thus far:

1. Java
2. NodeJS

TODO:

1. Java - Spring Boot
2. .NET Core
3. ASP.NET Core
4. Terraform
