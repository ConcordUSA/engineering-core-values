# Unit Testing

The main point of this repository is [UnitTestingBestPractices.md](./UnitTestingBestPractices.md). Also contained in this repo are very simple projects containing the referenced tests and implementations. Currently, there are examples for:

* [Java](./java-unit-test-demo)
* [Node.js](./node-unit-test-demo)

While the current examples are limited, if you'd like to contribute further examples, please feel free to send a pull request or reach out to me.

Also, any feedback on the document itself would be appreciated.
