# CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated integration of code
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment of software

## The What and the Why

Proper CI/CD automates the manual stuff and ensures that code is merged and released correctly.

- üèé Team velocity
- üíª Code accuracy
- ü§ì Developer happiness

## CI

CI is the task of regularly merging code changes. It allows for common tasks to be run to ensure code quality and integrity. Some common tasks/checks that happen at this stage are:

- Testing (unit, integration, &/or end-to-end)
- Linting (code format checks)
- Building/compiling
- Manual Code Reviews

If any issues or errors come up, they can be addressed before merging code into higher branches or environments. CI systems can also **require** that these checks pass prior to proceeding.

## CD

CD is the task of automating release and deployment of code to running environments. Common tasks/checks that happen at this stage are:

- Testing (unit, integration, &/or end-to-end)
- Linting (code format checks)
- Building/compiling
- Release versioning
- Deployment
