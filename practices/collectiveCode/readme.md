# Collective Code Ownership

In collective code ownership, the entire team is responsible for the code. Everyone works together to produce a product of quality. No one individual is greater than the rest of the team members. This practice helps to reduce the need for hero work and eliminate silos of information within the team.

## The What and the Why

### The What

Code ownership refers to who is allowed to modify and write certain portions of the code. Collective code ownership means the whole team has the ability and even duty to understand and edit every piece of code.

### The Why

Benefits of collective code ownership:

- Increases work velocity by not requiring work from a specific developer.
- Increases team communication
- Increases diffusion of technical knowledge
- Gives all developers a sense of responsibility to produce quality code.
