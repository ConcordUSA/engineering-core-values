# Simple Design

The simplest design is often (almost always) the best solution to a given problem. The simplest solution is the easiest to maintain and the easiest to change (assuming you have appropriate testing of course). The assertion here is that trying to "build for the future" or "build in extensibility" ends up being more costly as we cannot predict what future requirements will be. Solve for the now, iterate on future later.

## The What and the Why

### The What

Simple design is a design method that encourages implementing design details when you need them, not when you foresee you will need them. Another common acronym for this is ideology is YAGNI or "You Aren't Gonna Need It". Simple design requires an ongoing cycle of design and refactoring where design decisions are deferred to the last responsible moment and kept as simple as possible.
