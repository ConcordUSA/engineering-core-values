# Simple Design

The simplest design is often (almost always) the best solution to a given problem. The simplest solution is the easiest to maintain and the easiest to change (assuming you have appropriate testing of course). The assertion here is that trying to "build for the future" or "build in extensibility" ends up being more costly as we cannot predict what future requirements will be. Solve for the now, iterate on future later.
