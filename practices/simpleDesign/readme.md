# Simple Design

The simplest design is often (almost always) the best solution to a given problem. The simplest solution is the easiest to maintain, the easiest to change (assuming you have appropriate testing of course) and often provides extensibility and future reuse without adding complexity.

## The What and the Why

### The What

Simple design refers to designing your code in a simple, clean and elegant way. The following are guidelines to simple design:

- "You Aren't Gonna Need It"(YAGNI): Design details should be implemented when you need them, not when you foresee you will need them.
- Avoid duplication and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): duplicate code is hard to read, understand and and maintain.
- Self Documenting Code: Readable and clean code makes the code self documenting and lessens the need to maintain documentation in the code. Descriptive naming and a clean layout are key factors in writing self documenting code.
- Fail Fast: Test the limits of your design to determine where it will fail you and when improvements need to be made.
- Minimize the number of components: use the fewest number of classes and methods to achieve what you need.

### The Why

Simple design increases efficiency by only implementing what is necessary, and makes code easier to maintain and change.
